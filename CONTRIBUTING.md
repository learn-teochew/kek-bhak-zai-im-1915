Contributions to transcription of the dictionary data are welcome!

Please note the following:

 * You agree to release your contribution under a CC-BY-4.0 license
 * To avoid duplication of effort, please create a GitHub issue noting which chapter you intend to transcribe so we can coordinate
 * Use the following transcription conventions:
  * Each entry is tab-separated with four columns: character/word, 字母 (initial), 八聲 (tone), 十五音 (final)
  * Each character in the original with the same initial-tone-final has its own line
  * Do not fix apparent typos, but transcribe the original as far as possible, but note it in a comment.
  * Half-width text in the original represent annotations for the preceding character(s); these are transcribed enclosed in full-width brackets.
  * Some characters in the scan may not be recognizable. Use the roman letter `X` as a placeholder
  * Some characters may not have a Unicode encoding. Describe these with an ideographic description sequence (IDS) if possible, or use `X` as a placeholder.
